# Portfolio: Software Testing and Quality Assurance

## Project One: Contact Service

### Files Submitted:
- Contact.java
- ContactService.java
- ContactTest.java
- ContactServiceTest.java

### Summary:
Project One focused on developing a contact service for a mobile application. The service included functionalities to add, update, and delete contacts, validated through rigorous unit tests using JUnit. The contact service files demonstrate my proficiency in software testing, automation, and quality assurance.

### Reflection:
#### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring functional and secure code involves thorough testing at multiple levels. For the contact service, I implemented unit tests to validate all critical functionalities such as adding contacts with unique IDs and enforcing data constraints (e.g., contact ID length, mandatory fields). By testing edge cases and ensuring comprehensive coverage, I minimized the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities.

#### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs is essential for delivering software that meets stakeholder expectations. During the development of the contact service, I carefully reviewed requirements to understand user expectations regarding contact management. This guided the implementation of features and validation rules to ensure the service aligned with user needs effectively.

#### How do I approach designing software?
When approaching software design, I prioritize clarity, modularity, and scalability. In the contact service project, I structured the codebase to separate concerns between data management (Contact.java, ContactService.java) and testing (ContactTest.java, ContactServiceTest.java). This modular approach facilitates easier maintenance and future enhancements. Additionally, I adhere to best practices such as documenting code and maintaining clean architecture to support long-term software sustainability.

## Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report

### Files Submitted:
- Summary_and_Reflections_Report.docx

### Summary:
Project Two involved creating a summary and reflections report that evaluates the unit testing approach, experience with writing JUnit tests, and reflects on testing techniques and mindset applied in Project One. The report emphasizes the importance of effective software testing strategies and commitment to quality assurance.

### Reflection:
#### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functional and secure software, I emphasized rigorous testing and adherence to coding standards in Project One. The unit tests validated functionalities and security measures (e.g., data validation, error handling) to minimize vulnerabilities and ensure robust performance under various conditions.

#### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs involves active communication and understanding of requirements. Reflecting on Project One, I engaged with stakeholders to clarify requirements for the contact service, ensuring that user expectations for contact management were met through well-defined features and validation rules.

#### How do I approach designing software?
Designing software requires a systematic approach that considers scalability, maintainability, and user experience. In Project One, I followed a structured design process that involved modularizing components, implementing reusable code patterns, and incorporating feedback loops to refine functionality and user interface.
